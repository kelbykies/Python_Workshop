# How to install Anaconda & Python on your computer

## Installing Anaconda
"Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment. "

Please understand that Anaconda is one of many IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) used for coding in Python. I chose it for this workshop simply because it is simple. 

Other ways to code in Python include:

* other IDES: Pycharm, SPyder, Eclipse, etc. 
* command line or Terminal
* using the Python module when logged into an ISU cluster.

## Installing Python

When we download Anaconda, Python v.3 should be installed automatically. This is the version we want to use for our tutorial today. 

Note: There are different versions of Python and it is important to know which version you are using. Also, it is important to note which Python version someone else's code is using in case you need to debug.
